# Mechwarrior 5: Mercenaries [Mechlab](https://career404.github.io/MW5-mechlab)
This game doesn't get enough love - neither from players, nor from the developers. Mechwarrior Online had an online mechlab for ages! [Several](https://mwo.smurfy-net.de/mechlab) [iterations](https://mech.nav-alpha.com/), [in fact](https://mwo.nav-alpha.com/)!
It is time someone would restore the justice and give those in need to fool around a way to do it away from the game.
## TODO:
1. Struggling with GH-pages - the first thing to fix.
2. Actual mechlab is not ready yet. This should be a priority (this actually is the point of this project)
3. Connect with Yet Another Mechlab/weapons/weapons clan modders and allow for a full, uncut tinkering experience (mechlabbing without these mods is boring anyways). Adding mech variants from other mods would be cool too!
4. I wanted to implement a styling trick and change screenshots to illustrations on the click of a button - but we'll see if there's a point to that (I'm not sure whether there's enough new designs for all mechs)
